          A luxurious gem tucked away in a tranquil little pocket of Penestanan village, in Ubud, overlooking wild, beautiful jungle. It is a complex of 3 luxurious villas, shared common lounge area, saltwater pool, yoga studio, green rooftop lounge. A happy place.

        h5 Style

        p. Each of our 3 villas is surrounded by lush tropical gardens including organic gardens growing veggies, fruits and herbs. Our signature design style is to refurbish the antique Indonesian teakwood house to create a unique and striking blend of modernity and tradition. The up-cycled whitewashed wood and high ceilings brings light, brightness and a contemporary feeling in perfect balance with the traditional solid structure. The villas are the product of refined craftsmanship. As a designer, it is a pleasure to combine the modern elements of style and design to antique structures. We find it creates the perfect balance: light and solid, old and new at the same time.

          Our largest and most striking of the three villas is Joglo Raj. Beautiful, expansive and bright. It is best described as a combination of modern NYC loft and beautiful, rustic antique wooden house (joglo). The ceiling of this antique Javanese joglo peaks at 9 meters with whitewashed teakwood throughout. All the furniture including the beautiful 4-poster king-sized bed made from recycled wood is handcrafted. The joglo is air-conditioned with terrazzo floors, comfortable lounge area with sofa, TV/DVD player, breakfast bar, walk-in closet and folding glass doors that opens to a large terrace overlooking the pool.
