Dear Siteminder,

Please see [siteminder-letter-pt1](siteminder-letter-pt1.md) for background.

## High Priority

### Widget UX

Regarding your general widget functionality it seems very poor design to assume dates for a booking, logically it would make more sense to show this view *once the person has selected their dates*.

### XML Error

Please note regarding the XML error that this is thrown when simply embedding an iframe using this URL:

```
//app-apac.thebookingbutton.com/properties/manasari12direct?skin=0
```

## Medium Priority

### Widget Styling

Furthermore on the widget styling issues because you set `overflow: hidden` on the body of the iframe document we cannot use the iframe scrollbars correctly.
